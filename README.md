# google shearchResult page
  my first google search result page.
this is to test my ability to use cascading style sheet(css) to position, style and move containers around the web page.
this goole result page is respond=sive only on mobile devices therefor it is not to be tested on desktop or tablet devices untill any further 
upgrade or changes is been made.
